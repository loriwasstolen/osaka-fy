# Osaka-fy :D

> *"Sata Andagi!"*

**Osaka-fy** is a Tampermonkey UserScript that turns the entire internet into **Osaka (Ayumu Kasuga)** from *Azumanga Daioh*.

It replaces images, text, titles, and icons with the chaotic energy of everyone's favorite airhead. It is designed to work on static pages as well as complex Single Page Applications (SPAs) like YouTube and Twitter.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Image Replacement:** Swaps every `<img>` on a webpage with a curated collection of Osaka images.
*   **Text Conversion:** Replaces website text with iconic Osaka quotes (*"Oh my gah!", "America ya :D", "I guess I'm just an airhead"*).
*   **The "Enforcer":** actively fights against modern websites (like YouTube or Twitter) that try to revert images back to normal.
*   **Tab Hijacking:**
    *   **Dynamic Title:** Changes the browser tab name to short quotes every 15 seconds.
    *   **Dynamic Favicon:** Changes the website icon to Osaka and rotates it every 15 seconds.
*   **Settings Menu:** A built-in GUI to toggle specific features on or off.

## 📥 Installation

1.  **Install a UserScript Manager**
    *   [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Recommended for Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
    *   Violentmonkey or Greasemonkey also work.

2.  **Install the Script**
    *   Click the link below to install the script directly:
    *   **[Install osaka-fy.user.js](https://github.com/loriwasstolen/osaka-fy/releases/download/release/osaka-fy.user.js)**
    *   Your extension should automatically ask to install it. Click **Install**.

    *   Refresh any webpage and enjoy the chaos.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You don't need to edit the code to change settings!

1.  Click the **Tampermonkey icon** in your browser's extension bar.
2.  Click **"Open Osaka Settings"** under the script menu.
3.  A menu will appear on the screen allowing you to toggle:
    *   **Replace Images** (On by default)
    *   **Replace Text** (On by default)
    *   **Replace Backgrounds** (Off by default - aggressive mode)
    *   **Osaka Favicon** (On by default)

## 🔧 Compatibility

*   **Works on:** Wikipedia, Google, YouTube, Twitter (X), Reddit, GitHub, and most standard websites.
*   **Note:** Some highly secure websites (banking, Facebook) may block external images due to Content Security Policy (CSP). The text replacement will still work, but images might not load on those specific sites.

## 📝 Quotes Included

The script randomly cycles through quotes including:
*   "Sata Andagi!"
*   "Oh my gah!"
*   "Why is it... that you are a cat?"
*   "Just give me the knife."
*   "I always wanted to go to the ocean and ride a dolphin."
*   ...and many more.
